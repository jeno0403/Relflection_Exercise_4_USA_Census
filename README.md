# Ratio Estimator Analysis for 2022 ACS Data
## Overview
This project analyzes data from the 2022 American Community Survey (ACS) provided by [IPUMS USA](https://usa.ipums.org/usa/). The primary focus is to estimate the total number of respondents in each state using the ratio estimator method, based on the number of respondents holding doctoral degrees. This estimation is then compared to the actual number of respondents from the ACS dataset.

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:
-   An R project `USDocAnalysis.Rproj` is used.
-   `IPUM_2022_California.qmd` is the quarto document used to generate pdf document.
-   `reference.bib` is used to generate the citation.
-   The project is a collaborative work by Amy Jin,Yiyue Deng and Jinyan Wei.

## Data
Data should not be uploaded due to IPUMS requirements. The paper provides instructions on how to obtain the data.

## Statement on LLM usage

Some code for data analysis and sentence phrasings had assistance from ChatGPT 4.0, mainly modifying grammar and presenting data in a more aesthetic form. The prompts and outputs were documented along with the entire chat history in `LLM-Usage.txt`.
