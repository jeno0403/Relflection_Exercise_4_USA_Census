# Ratio Estimator Analysis for 2022 ACS Data
## Overview
This project uses the ratio estimators approach of Laplace to estimate the total number of respondents in each state by using the ratio between the number of respondents with doctoral degrees in California and the number of respondents in California.
This project contains data from IPUMS(not included for confidential reasons) to analyze respondents and educational levels. The project contains limited information about the data itself and only analysis of the result. The result will be generated in the form of a pdf produced by Quarto. 

## File Structure

The repo is structured as:
-   An R project `W4 Reflection.Rproj` is used.
-   `IPUM_2022_California.qmd` is the quarto document used to generate pdf document
-   The project is a collaborative work by Amy Jin, Claire Ma, Diana Shen, Jinyan Wei, and Maggie Zhang from group 100.

## Data
Due to IPUMS requirements, data should not be uploaded. Instructions on how to obtain the data are stated in the paper.

## Statement on LLM usage

Some code for data analysis and sentence phrasings had assistance from ChatGPT 4.0, mainly modifying grammar and presenting data in a more aesthetic form. The prompts and outputs were documented along with the entire chat history in `LLMDocumentation.txt`.
